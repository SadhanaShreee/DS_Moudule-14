# Ex7 Priority Queue
## DATE:
## AIM:
To formulate the C code to display the elements of the priority queue after insertion and deletion operation.

## Algorithm
1. Start
2. Define a function printArray() that takes an array and its size as parameters.
3. Loop through the array from index 0 to size-1.
4. Print each element of the array during the loop.
5. After printing all elements, print a newline for formatting.
6. End
 

## Program:
```

  for(i=0;i<size;i++){
      printf("%d ",array[i]);
  }
}

```
